## Editor / terminal

- My preferred editor is [neovim](https://neovim.io/). I've used all the other
  editors over the years, but neovim makes me work most efficiently. Here
  are my [dotfiles](https://rlaur.in/dotfiles) for the curious.

- My editor font is [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code).
  I used to love [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) but was suffering from
  integration problems with my terminal. I want to use [MonoLisa](http://monolisa.dev/) when the issues with kitty have been fixed.

- My editor theme is [a modified version](https://github.com/believer/night-owl) of [Night Owl](https://github.com/haishanh/night-owl.vim) by [Sarah Drasner](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/) to vim.

- My terminal of choice is [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) with
  [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) on top of it. The color scheme I use in kitty can be found in [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/believer/386b977c3363e73073d4d14848dc1af7). Tmux configuration can be found in my [Dotfiles](https://github.com/believer/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf).

## Desktop

- My browser is currently Brave

## Desk setup

- I use a 16" MacBook Pro. 2,6 GHz i7, 32 GB RAM, Radeon Pro 5300M 4 GB, 500 GB HDD. Really disliked the touch bar and built-in keyboard of the old 15", so I mostly used that tethered, but the new 16" has a really great keyboard. Feels awesome to be able to work on the actual laptop again.

- My keyboard is a [WASD](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/) with Cherry
  MX Clear switches and a custom color design. I've used it for {% keyboardDays %}
  years and couldn't love it more. I've paired it with an Apple Magic Trackpad 2. I also have a [Razer Goliathus Control](https://www.razer.com/eu-en/gaming-mouse-mats/razer-goliathus-control) mouse mat because I like the feel of it.

- I have a [IKEA Skarsta](https://www.ikea.com/se/sv/p/skarsta-skrivbord-sitt-sta-vit-s59324818/) desk and a [IKEA Markus](https://www.ikea.com/se/sv/p/markus-kontorsstol-vissle-moerkgra-70261150/) chair. Dreaming of a home office with a Jarvis desk and a Herman Miller Aeron chair.
