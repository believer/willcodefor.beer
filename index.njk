      <p>Iteam is a development consultancy working mostly in-house.</p>

      <p>My work focused on front-end, but also
      backend (Node) whenever there's a need. We use React and React Native
      with TypeScript, but recently we've also started using ReasonML.
      We write all code using TDD and Jest. API integrations are made using
      GraphQL, with some REST.</p>
