Describe what you're going to do and why before actually doing it when you're teaching something to someone.

The student will have a harder time following what you're doing if the code you're writing just "magically appears". This becomes even more relevant depending on the student's level of knowledge.

If they have any objections or questions, they'll also get the time to ask them.

By putting words to what you're doing you'll also get to think it through.

This might be even more helpful when working remotely as you don't get the same connection as when you're sitting by the same computer.
