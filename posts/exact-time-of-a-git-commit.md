Yesterday I was combining my blog post and my TIL posts and I wanted to find out the exact time of a git commit. It turns out that it's really easy. If you hover the date of a commit, you'll see the full date and time.

If you want an even more precise time that includes seconds or if you just want to get the time using the terminal, you can use the following command.

```bash
git show -s --format=%ci <commit-sha>
# 2022-02-23 13:27:44 +0100
```

- `-s`  â€“ Removes the diff
- `--format=%ci`  - Only display the date in an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)-like format (use `%cI` if you need strict ISO 8601-format)
