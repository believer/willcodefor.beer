Share your knowledge and insights. To do this in the most effective way you'll need to [Explain in plain words](/posts/explain-in-plain-words). This "forces" you to refine your thinking until you can explain the topic in the most accessible way.

By learning and building in public you'll sooner or later post something that resonates with someone else. This feedback might lead to new insights and even better knowledge.
