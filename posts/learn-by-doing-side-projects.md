I can honestly say that building a bunch of side projects has made me a better developer. I get to actively work on different problems, try new things and improve my knowledge. Dan Abramov has the same [take](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1461650348842569735) on how to become a better frontend developer: "Build a UI. Build a UI. Build a UI…".

>Practice makes perfect

Have **one specific project**, a project you know _exactly_ how you want it to work, to test out new ideas, technologies, and frameworks on. If it contains multiple parts, like interacting with an API or how to contain state, it's a perfect project to evaluate new technologies with.

In his book Atomic Habits, author James Clear writes about a university professor that split his photography class in two groups. One group would be graded on _quantity_, i.e., as many photos as possible, and the other on _quality_, i.e., only _one_ photo (better make it a good one). The best results came from the quantity group. They got the chance to take a bunch of photos and could learn from their experiences which produced better results.

The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity. This was first described by Donald Hebb in his book The Organization of Behavior in 1949. It's commonly known as Hebb's rule: “Neurons that fire together wire together.“

You can potentially learn even more by [Learning in public](/posts/learning-in-public). Learning others means that you need a better understanding of the problem in order to convey it effectively.
